    "## TF-IDF Weighting Scheme\n",
    "The tf-idf weighting scheme is an improvement over the simple term count or term frequency scheme we just saw. It is frequently used in text mining applications and has been shown to be effective. It combines two term statistics components:\n",
    "1. _Local component_: term count or term frequency (tf) reflects how important a word is to a document locally. For more details you can refer to [this link](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/term-frequency-and-weighting-1.html).\n",
    "2. _Global component_: inverse document frequency (idf) of a word reflects how important the word is to the entire corpus or collection of documents. _Document frequency_ (df) of a word is the number of documents in the corpus where the word appears. A term with higher $df$ is a common term, thus carries less importance. $idf$ is an inverse function of $df$. So higher $idf$ means higher importance of the term globally. For more details you can refer to [this link](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/inverse-document-frequency-1.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight vector for document $d$ under tf-idf scheme is $v_d=[w_{1,d} , w_{2,d},\\ldots, w_{N,d}]$ where $w_{t,d}=tf_{t,d}\\times\\log\\frac{|D|}{|d'\\in D | t\\in d'| + 1}$ In the denominator we have added 1 to avoid division by zero, which is called smoothing. \n",

    "Scikit-learn has your back, it already provides the **TfidfVectorizer** module to compute TF-IDF matrix.\n",
